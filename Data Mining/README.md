1. Why? (Motivate your idea; is it interesting, important, relevant?)
To sell the other products in the market to the customer by placing a distance between the
products sold in the market.
2. What? (Exactly what do you propose?)
To find the best selling 2s and 3s products with the market receipt data.
3. How? (State your hypothesis and evaluation procedure)
By pulling the data from the market database, we will make the arrangement we want, and
then we want to establish a suggestion mechanism by designing the apriori algorithm in
Python.
